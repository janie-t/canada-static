    title: About Us
    paragraphs:
      - We put purpose before profit.
      - >
        Thankyou Payroll is a Wellington based social business that aims to create holistic benefits.
        We provide free payroll intermediary services to SMEs and charities all over New Zealand. We
        use an IRD subsidy to cover our costs and we put 25 cents per person, per pay (up to $1.25 per
        client) into the Thankyou Charitable Trust, which distributes funds to community organisations
        around New Zealand.
      - >
        It all began in 2009, in Dunedin when Hugh Davidson saw an opportunity to leverage an IRD
        payroll subsidy to create community good. From the musty depths of a Port Chalmers garage,
        version one of the online payroll system emerged. Steady improvement and word of mouth saw the
        company grow in clients, staff and service features. In 2013 we launched version two of
        Thankyou Payroll, with a complete redesign, greater versatility, easier integration with
        external services like Xero and a range of other client focused features.
      - >
        We now work with thousands of clients all over New Zealand and process millions of dollars
        worth of pays each week. We have opened a Wellington office, which has become our HQ and we
        continue to focus on maintaining a great work environment because dang! it makes life more fun
        when you love the work.
